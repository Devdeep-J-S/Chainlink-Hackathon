# Chainlink Hackathon Project

This repository contains the code and documentation for my submission to the Chainlink Hackathon. The project, named "NFT Bazaar," is an online marketplace that enables users to list, sell, and buy Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). It leverages the power of Chainlink data feeds to provide accurate and real-time information about the value and authenticity of listed NFTs.

## Inspiration

The inspiration behind NFT Bazaar stems from the growing popularity and potential of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). With the increasing adoption of NFTs in the digital art world, I recognized the need for a reliable and user-friendly platform where artists can showcase their unique creations, and collectors can explore and acquire one-of-a-kind digital assets. This project aims to bridge the gap between artists and collectors by creating a seamless marketplace for NFT transactions.

## Chainlink Data Hackathon

NFT Bazaar is developed as part of the Chainlink Hackathon, which provided an excellent opportunity to leverage the capabilities of Chainlink data feeds. By integrating Chainlink, we ensure that our platform provides accurate and up-to-date information regarding the value and authenticity of listed NFTs. Chainlink's decentralized oracle network is utilized to fetch real-time market data, enabling users to make informed decisions based on reliable information.

## Features

- **User-friendly interface:** NFT Bazaar offers an intuitive and easy-to-use interface for listing, selling, and buying NFTs.
- **Chainlink data feeds integration:** Real-time market data and pricing information are fetched using Chainlink's decentralized oracle network, ensuring accuracy and reliability.
- **Secure transactions:** The platform leverages smart contract functionality to enable secure and transparent transactions on the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Seamless user experience:** Attention to detail in design and user interface elements ensures a smooth and enjoyable experience for artists and collectors.
